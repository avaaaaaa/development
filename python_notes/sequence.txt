* the last item in a sequence: sequence[-1]
  the second last item in a sequence: sequence[-2]


* unpacking a sequence
x = [1, 2]
a, b = x       # a = 1, b = 2
s = “hey”
a, b, c = s    # a = ‘h’, b = ‘e’, c = ‘y’


* reversing a sequence
x = x[:: -1]


* check if a sequence is empty
if <sequence>:
    # the sequence is not empty
else:
    # the sequence is empty
