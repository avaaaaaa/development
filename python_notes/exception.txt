* general structure
try
except
else


*try-except-else
	x = 2
	y = 3
	try:
		result = x / y
	except ZeroDivisionError:
		print("divider cannot be zero")
	else:
		print(result)

* if you are not sure what exception needs to be handled,
avoid bare except block and use Exception to get info about the error
	try:
		...
	except Exception as e:
		print(e, type(e))
	except:
		# avoid this
		pass
