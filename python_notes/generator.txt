* generator objects don't create the entire result at once

* useful when working with large datasets


*
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [i*2 for i in x]  # list comprehension, returns the entire list
z = (i*2 for i in x)  # generator expression, returns an iterator
print(y[2])
    # 6
print(z[2])
    # TypeError: 'generator' object is not subscriptable
    # need to iterate or list(z)[2]
